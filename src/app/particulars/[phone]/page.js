/**
 * ParticularsPage
 * 
 * Overview:
 * The ParticularsPage is a React functional component that serves as a page within a Next.js application. It is designed to display the ParticularsComponent, passing a phone number as a prop. This page is structured to provide a minimalistic and responsive layout, ensuring that the ParticularsComponent is the focal point of the page.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Dynamic Prop Passing: Receives a `params` object as props, which contains the phone number to be passed to the ParticularsComponent.
 * - Responsive Design: Utilizes Tailwind CSS classes to create a flexible and responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
 * - Minimalistic Layout: The page is designed with a focus on simplicity, using a transparent background and minimal padding to keep the attention on the ParticularsComponent.
 * 
 * Implementation Details:
 * - The page imports the ParticularsComponent from a relative path, indicating that it is a custom component designed to collect or display user particulars.
 * - It uses a functional component structure with destructuring to extract `params` directly in the function signature, showcasing a modern React pattern for prop handling.
 * - The main content of the page is wrapped in a `<main>` tag with Tailwind CSS classes applied for styling. These classes are chosen to create a flexible column layout with justified content distribution and minimal padding at the bottom.
 * - The ParticularsComponent is rendered within the main content area, with the `phone` prop passed to it derived from the `params` object. This demonstrates how dynamic data can be passed down through components in a React application.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * This page is intended to be used as part of a user particulars collection or display flow within a Next.js application. It is specifically tailored for scenarios where a phone number is passed as a dynamic parameter, possibly from URL parameters or a previous page's state.
