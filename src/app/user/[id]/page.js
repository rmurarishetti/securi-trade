/**
 * UserStatusPage
 * 
 * Overview:
 * The UserStatusPage is a React functional component designed for a Next.js application. It serves the purpose of displaying the UserStatusComponent, which is responsible for showing the status of a user based on an identifier (e.g., ID). The page is client-side rendered, as indicated by the "use client" directive, optimizing the performance and user experience by executing JavaScript directly in the browser.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Client-Side Rendering: Utilizes the "use client" directive for improved performance and user experience by rendering the component directly in the user's browser.
 * - Dynamic Data Passing: The page receives a `params` object as props, which contains an `id` that is passed to the UserStatusComponent. This allows for dynamic rendering of user-specific information.
 * - Minimalistic and Responsive Design: The page layout is designed with Tailwind CSS to be minimalistic and responsive, ensuring that it adapts well to various screen sizes and maintains focus on the content.
 * 
 * Implementation Details:
 * - The page imports the UserStatusComponent from a designated path, indicating a modular approach to the application's architecture.
 * - React's functional component pattern is used, with destructuring applied to the props parameter to directly access the `params` object. This demonstrates a modern and concise approach to handling props in React components.
 * - The main content area is structured using a `<main>` tag with Tailwind CSS classes for styling. These classes are chosen to create a flexible and responsive layout that emphasizes the content.
 * - The UserStatusComponent is rendered within the main content area, with the `id` prop passed to it derived from the `params` object. This showcases how dynamic parameters can be utilized to render user-specific information in a Next.js application.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * This page is intended for use within applications that require displaying user status or information based on a unique identifier. It is particularly suited for user profiles, status checks, or any scenario where individual user data needs to be displayed dynamically.
