/**
 * Navbar Component
 * 
 * Overview:
 * The Navbar component is a React functional component designed for use in a Next.js application. It utilizes client-side rendering for optimal performance and user experience. The component displays a navigation bar at the top of the page, including a logo and a set of navigational links defined in the `NavLinks` constant. The navbar's appearance and behavior are responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Dynamic Route Highlighting: Utilizes the `usePathname` hook from Next.js to determine the current route and highlight the corresponding navigation link.
 * - Responsive Design: Tailored to adapt to various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS, including specific styles for small screens (e.g., `sm:flex hidden`).
 * - Custom Logo Display: Incorporates an Image component from Next.js to display a custom logo, enhancing brand visibility.
 * - External Style Reference: Uses a `styles` object imported from "../constants/styles" for consistent styling across components.
 * - Hover Effects: Navigation links change color on hover, improving user interaction and visual feedback.
 * 
 * Implementation Details:
 * - The component structure begins with a `<header>` tag, indicating its role as a page header.
 * - A `<nav>` element is used to define the navigation area, applying Tailwind CSS classes for styling and layout, including responsiveness and fixed positioning at the top of the viewport.
 * - The logo is rendered using the Next.js Image component for optimized loading and performance. It is placed inside a flex container alongside the site title, which is linked to the homepage using the Next.js Link component.
 * - Navigation links are dynamically generated from the `NavLinks` constant, each wrapped in a `<li>` element. These links are styled conditionally based on the current route, highlighting the active link.
 * - Conditional styling is also applied to the bottom border of the active navigation link, providing a visual cue to indicate the current page.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * This component is intended for use as a global navigation bar in a Next.js web application. It provides users with easy access to different sections of the site, enhancing the overall navigation experience.
